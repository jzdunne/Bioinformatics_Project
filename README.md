This project aims to display data about Cystic Fibrosis on a webpage in a database. 
Currently I am at the stage where I have downloaded the data and written a parser which extracts the data I want to make tables I can link through a database.
Comments on each part of the code are available at the file my_parser_template.py and I plan on modifying this to extract more data into tables after I have grasped futher concepts.
I have a code creating and linking this data into three tables based on accession number, ID reference and the results of the experiments. I will expand this code to create at least 5 linked tables with some more of the data. Currently my table code is effective and increasing the number of tables shouldn't take too long. (SQL_table_code)
I am now working through the information on webpages as I am unsure about the class part of the plan however am still trying to utilise my time.
I have completed various webpage examples and these can be seen at http://ts-ug-dev.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/~jzdunne/index.html.
At this weeks lab I hope for information on writing classes in python and the purpose of this.
