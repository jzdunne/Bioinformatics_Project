		<h1>Gene Expression and Cystic Fibrosis</h1>
		It is believed that a specific base pair deletion in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is responsible for cystic fibrosis in many cases. To test this hypothesis, the rectal mucosal epithelia from affected and unaffected individuals was analysed.
Through measuring the gene expression of the genes coding for the transmembrane conductance regulator, it can be seen if there is a correlation between the expression value of a gene and if the subject is a Cystic Fibrosis sufferer or not. 
		<p>The data from this study has been analysed and selecting an Entrez Gene ID returns information on the sample and the average expression of the gene in Cystic Fibrosis sufferers and those that do not.</p>
