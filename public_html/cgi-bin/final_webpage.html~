		<h1>Gene Expression and Cystic Fibrosis</h1>
		It is believed that a specific base pair deletion in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is responsible for cystic fibrosis in many cases. To test this hypothesis, the rectal mucosal epithelia from affected and unaffected individuals was analysed.
		<p>The data from this study has been analysed and selecting an Entrez Gene ID returns information on the sample and the expression of the gene.</p>
